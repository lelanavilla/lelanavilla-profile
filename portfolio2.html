                                    <li>Site must provide the owner with a way to add work to his portfolio himself.</li>
                                    <li>Work added must automatically be included to the portfolio page.</li>
                                    <li>A booking application for site must be created that notifies the owner when a potential client schedules a booking.</li>
                                    <li>Site must visually represent the companies image, with bright contrasts, and a landing page that grabs your attention, but isnt crowded. </li>

                                    For this project I built a server, and created a private API with mongoDB, mongoose, and express, so I could call this API to populate the portfolio page with the photographers images, and provide the ability to add more images. The owner didnt want to
                                    have to sign into the site to add images, and didnt want anything on the site that suggested that this option even existed. The site also required the creation of a booking application so potential clients could when schedule
                                    appointments, and the notification be automatically sent to the owner by email.

                                <p>A MERN stack application that utilizes third-party APIs. A group project done remotely, creating an mini social networking site for organzing group travel.
                                   The site allows users to collaborate together to plan out the
                                  activites for their group vacation, no matter the distance between them. 
                                  The user can vote on the activities the other group members have contributed, and in the end the app creates the schedule for the group, with
                                  the activities, and destinations that were voted in by the whole group. The number of activites depends on the length of time the group will be staying somewhere, and the distance the group sets as a parameter for the
                                  search. Ultimately, allowing everyone to take part in the planning aspect of a group vacation.

                                  This was a group project that was done remotely, as I was in California and my teammates were in Utah.
                                  A challenge I encountered while doing this project, besides the short two week time frame until its due date, was 
                                  when designing the visual look of the site. Our team chunked up the duties and I found it is difficult to design a site without all the hard details laid out.
                                  And with the short time frame needed all of the two weeks to complete. I finally decided to create a basic html mockups of each page on codepen.io, which allowed me to 
                                  visually see an overall picture of the site. And when it came time to inject them as JSX into the React Site we had built, 
                                  I just pieced the html/css code into the desired components.</p>
