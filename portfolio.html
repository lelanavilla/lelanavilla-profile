                                <li>Site must provide the owner with a way to add work to his portfolio himself.</li>
                                <li>Work added must automatically be included to the portfolio page.</li>
                                <li>A booking application for site must be created that notifies the owner when a potential client schedules a booking.</li>
                                <li>Site must visually represent the companies image, with bright contrasts, and a landing page that grabs your attention, but isnt crowded. </li>

                                For this project I built a server, and created a private API with mongoDB, mongoose, and express, so I could call this API to populate the portfolio page with the photographers images, and provide the ability to add more images. The owner didnt want to
                                have to sign into the site to add images, and didnt want anything on the site that suggested that this option even existed. The site also required the creation of a booking application so potential clients could when schedule
                                appointments, and the notification be automatically sent to the owner by email.

                                    the activities, and destinations that were voted in by the whole group. The number of activites depends on the length of time the group will be staying somewhere, and the distance the group sets as a parameter for the
